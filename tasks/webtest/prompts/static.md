# Web Application Testing

To test local web applications, write native Python Playwright scripts.

**Always run scripts with `--help` first** to see usage. DO NOT read the source until you try running the script first and find that a customized solution is abslutely necessary. These scripts can be very large and thus pollute your context window. They exist to be called directly as black-box scripts rather than ingested into your context window.

## Decision Tree: Choosing Your Approach

```
User task → Is it static HTML?
    ├─ Yes → Read HTML file directly to identify selectors
    │         ├─ Success → Write Playwright script using selectors
    │         └─ Fails/Incomplete → Treat as dynamic (below)
    │
    └─ No (dynamic webapp) → Is the server already running?
        ├─ No → Run: python scripts/with_server.py --help
        │        Then use the helper + write simplified Playwright script
        │
        └─ Yes → Reconnaissance-then-action:
            1. Navigate and wait for networkidle
            2. Take screenshot or inspect DOM
            3. Identify selectors from rendered state
            4. Execute actions with discovered selectors
```

## Common Pitfall

❌ **Don't** inspect the DOM before waiting for `networkidle` on dynamic apps
✅ **Do** wait for `page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')` before inspection

## Best Practices

- Use `sync_playwright()` for synchronous scripts
- Always close the browser when done
- Use descriptive selectors: `text=`, `role=`, CSS selectors, or IDs
- Add appropriate waits: `page.wait_for_selector()` or `page.wait_for_timeout()`

## Reference Files

static_html_automation.py
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
import os

# Example: Automating interaction with static HTML files using file:// URLs

html_file_path = os.path.abspath('path/to/your/file.html')
file_url = f'file://{html_file_path}'

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
    page = browser.new_page(viewport={'width': 1920, 'height': 1080})

    # Navigate to local HTML file
    page.goto(file_url)

    # Take screenshot
    page.screenshot(path='/mnt/user-data/outputs/static_page.png', full_page=True)

    # Interact with elements
    page.click('text=Click Me')
    page.fill('#name', 'John Doe')
    page.fill('#email', 'john@example.com')

    # Submit form
    page.click('button[type="submit"]')
    page.wait_for_timeout(500)

    # Take final screenshot
    page.screenshot(path='/mnt/user-data/outputs/after_submit.png', full_page=True)

    browser.close()

print("Static HTML automation completed!")
